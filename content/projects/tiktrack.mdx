Hi üëã

I published a new app called TikTrack on the apple AppStore with [Playense](https://playense.com) ‚ù§Ô∏è.

This is a TikTok tracking app. Users can load analytics for a video using a video URL, check other creators, what videos are working for them, what's trending in a hashtag, what's trending right now, etc. Users can also bookmark videos, music, and other creators. Also, users can download videos with no watermark to repost on other platforms.

This app is built with React Native. For API calls and caching I used React Query, for state management I used Jotai with AsyncStorage. To manage payment I used RevenueCat. It has also light and dark theme support.
